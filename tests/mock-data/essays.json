    "content": "Vacation time is meant for relaxing. The last thing that I want to think about when I am on vacation is work stuffs or what I should do to improve myself in my job. It is true that it would be nice to stay at a beachside hotel for 4 days, but my concern is, how much of this hotel or time will we get to enjoy? The training could take us the entire day and by the time we get back to our hotel we will be too tired to do anything else to enjoy ourselves. This will mean that we basically won't be having any real \"Vacation Time\". I would trade this 4 days at the beachside hotel with my 2 days vacation time to fully enjoy and relax myself and also spend some quality time with my family and friends. I agree that job training is important, but not at the cost of my personal \"healing\" time. What I mean by that is, during my vacation time, I take some time off to do some meditation and relief myself of all the stress of work and life. I believe that this helps me to restore my physical and mental health.",
